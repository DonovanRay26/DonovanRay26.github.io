									<h3 class="major">Who Am I?</h3>
									<p>I am a fourth-year student at the University of Virginia pursuing a B.S in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering Business through the School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am interested in Quantitative Research and Development, Software Engineering, and Machine Learning. I am currently a Quantitative Development intern at Sabrepoint Capital Management in Dallas, Texas - as well as an undergraduate researcher in the Computer Science department at UVA with a focus on theoretical computer science.</p>

									<p>In the past I have served as the risk manager and president of my fraternity, and currently serve as the house manager. Following a house fire in December of 2024, I led the strategic and operational transition to a new property. This has coordination with Charlottesville utility and emergency services, negotiating lease agreements, and managing all general logistics, which challenged and developed my leadership, crisis management, and operational planning skills.</p>

									<p>In my free time I enjoy learning about finance, fitness, and music. I have read Ernest Chan's <i>Quantitative Trading</i> and <i>Algorithmic Trading</i>, Peter Lynch's <i>One Up on Wall Street</i>, Joel Greenblatt's <i>Little Book that Beats the Market</i>, and Greenwald and Kahn's <i>Value Investing</i> textbook. I am currently reading Shreve's <i>Stochastic Calculus for Finance I</i>, and am looking forward to reading the second volume. Through this, I have gained an interest in the overlap between quantitative and fundamental investing, and highly recommend these books to anyone interested.</p>
