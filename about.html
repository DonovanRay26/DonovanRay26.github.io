    <section class="card">
      <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science, completing an Engineering Business minor with an expected graduation date of May 2026.</p>
      <p>My core interests are quantitative research, machine learning, and software engineering, especially where modeling, system design, and production infrastructure overlap in high-impact environments.</p>
      <p>I recently completed a Quantitative Research and Development internship at Sabrepoint Capital Management, where I worked on signal research, model development, and full-stack research platform engineering.</p>
      <p>I am also an incoming Junior Analyst at Sabrepoint Capital Management, where I will focus on short-side equity research and data signaling.</p>
      <p>I also conduct undergraduate information theory research under Professor Farzad Farnoud, focused on smooth compression methods and algorithmic improvements to Huffman encoding.</p>
