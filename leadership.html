                <h3 class="major">Sigma Pi Fraternity, Beta Pi Chapter</h3>
                <p>I currently serve as the President of my fraternity. In this position I have developed growth strategies, directed and managed executive efforts of the fraternity, worked in coordination with University of Virginia organizations such as the Inter-Fraternity Council, and worked with Sigma Pi's National Organization to ensure chapter success. In December, we unfortunately faced a house fire which put us out of the chapter house. As president, I've led the fraternity through this difficult time and am happy to say that although we did not have a house, we've managed to continue to recruit/rush, hold social events, hold philanthropy events, and have continued regular chapter operations. I'm excited to say that we've finalized a lease on a new house, and will be living there in the meantime while our chapter house is repaired. I also have structured and developed a six-figure operational budget for the upcoming academic year.</p>
                <p>I served as the Risk Management Chair, Formal Chair, Social Media Chair, and the Alumni Relations Chair for my fraternity from 2023 to 2024. In my time in these positions I have coordinated and budgeted events for a total of ~$10,000. I have also developed risk management strategies to ensure the safety of all of our guests in coordination with the UVA IFC and Sigma Pi national organization, I have implemented strategies to limit brotherhood liabilities, and I have drafted legal documentation for the rental of our house as an event venue.</p>
