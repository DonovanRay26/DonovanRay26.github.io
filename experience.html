				<h3 class="major">Quantitative Research and Development Intern - Sabrepoint Capital Management</h3>
				<p><strong>Dec. 2024 - Aug. 2025 | Dallas, TX</strong></p>
				<p>Developed data signaling research and infrastructure with an iterative 24% increase in signal efficacy/win rate. Researched and developed strategy-specific signal algorithms using algorithmic trading, financial machine learning backtested on a wide range of equities.</p>
				<p>Utilized Geometric Brownian Motion with superimposed custom price-action, Wavelet Transforms, Savitzky-Golay filtering, among other preprocessing and feature engineering strategies to train an XGBoost model and tested out-of-sample across 385 equities with walk-forward validation to achieve a win rate of 64% and Sharpe Ratio of 1.8, with event studies, Spearman and Pearson information coefficients, and predictive regression results verifying model's predictive power.</p>
				<p>Built full stack research portal with FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend, featuring real-time signal generation and analysis through a microservices architecture. Implemented robust data pipeline with PostgreSQL persistence, Redis caching, and containerized deployment using Docker.</p>
				<p>Developed modern, responsive UI with real-time updates using WebSocket communication and comprehensive security features including role-based access control and encrypted data transmission. Constructed DCF model with Monte Carlo simulations using hybrid stochastic processes modeling commodity price change and volatility, affecting modeled free cash flow growth with historic FCF-commodity exposure to assist in discretionary/fundamental research.</p>

				<h3 class="major">Information Theory Undergraduate Researcher â€“ Smooth Compression</h3>
				<p><strong>Jan. 2024 - Present | Charlottesville, VA</strong></p>
				<p>Under Professor Farzad Farnoud in the University of Virginia Department of Computer Science, conducting mathematical, algorithmic, and information-theory based research into Huffman encoding and their use in compression algorithms with a focus on text compression.</p>
				<p>Developed various different algorithmic approaches to achieving smooth compression through Huffman encoding with the use of Hamming distances, adjacency matrices, and novel algorithmic alterations to the Huffman encoding algorithm. Improved smoothness/consistency of encoding by 23% while maintaining lossless compression.</p>
				<p>Developed full-stack testing environment with multithreaded optimization for large data compression and compute-intensive testing.</p>

				<h3 class="major">Software Development Intern - Creative Realities Inc.</h3>
				<p><strong>Summer 2023 | Dallas, TX</strong></p>
				<p>In this role I gained experience working with Node.js, Vue.js, and React.js in a software development team. For my deliverables, I produced internal software to integrate with and help company operations.</p>
				<p>This was an excellent opportunity for me to understand what it means to be part of a software development team. I underwent an onboarding process, went to stand-up meetings, coordinated with employees, read documentation for software I had never used before, and gained experience with said software through reading existing code and implementing new code.</p>

				<h3 class="major">Engineering Lead - NASA High School Aerospace Scholars Moonshot Challenge</h3>
				<p><strong>Summer 2021 | Houston, TX</strong></p>
				<p>After my completion of NASA's HAS independent study program, I was invited to compete in the NASA HAS Moonshot challenge over the course of 1 week during the summer of 2021. For this challenge, I was the engineering lead for my team. I directed the prototyping of a EVA helmet designed for lunar exploration in the NASA Artemis missions.</p>
