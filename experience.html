				<h3 class="major">Undergraduate Researcher - University of Virginia</h3>
				<p>Under Professor Farzad Farnoud in the University of Virginia Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, my research team and I are researching Smooth Compression, a topic in the Information Theory field. In my time in this team, I have developed a testing environment in Python with a tkinter-based GUI with capability to let user test any type of algorithm as long as it follows basic standards, allowed for heavy-compute testing through multithreading in the Python Concurrent Futures library, allowed for data analysis through data visualization in the GUI, data management with pandas, and export to .xlsx files using openpyxl.</p>
				<p>I have also developed and researched various compression algorithms through Applied Mathematics literature and theory, Data Structures and Algorithms concepts, and Mathematics of Information concepts, then tested these algorithms through my testing environment. The goal of these algorithms is to achieve Smooth Compression, which can be described as compression where the compressed data will not change drastically as the original data changes between compression.</p>
				<p>This role has taught me a lot about Information Theory, Applied Mathematics, and mostly, software development. In developing the testing environment, I quickly gained experience with refactoring and avoiding tech debt. Having to write code that will need to be able to implement more and more complex, different, and unique algorithms for various testing methods required me to write code that is for anything. Avoiding tech debt is critical in this project as I often need to look back on my code and implement code from the past.</p>



				<h3 class="major">Software Development Intern - Creative Realities Inc.</h3>
				<p>In this role I gained experience working with Node.js, Vue.js, and React.js in a software development team. For my deliverables, I produced internal software to integrate with and help company operations. </p>
				<p>This was an excellent opportunity for me to understand what it means to be part of a software development team. I underwent an onboarding process, went to stand-up meetings, coordinated with employees, read documentation for software I had never used before, and gained experience with said software through reading existing code and implementing new code.</p>

				<h3 class="major">Engineering Lead - NASA High School Aerospace Scholars Moonshot Challenge</h3>
				<p>After my completion of NASA's HAS independent study program, I was invited to compete in the NASA HAS Moonshot challenge over the course of 1 week during the summer of 2021. For this challenge, I was the engineering lead for my team. I directed the prototyping of a EVA helmet designed for lunar exploration in the NASA Artemis missions.</p>
